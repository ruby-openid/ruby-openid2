# Appraisal Root Gemfile is for running appraisal to generate the Appraisal Gemfiles
#   in gemfiles/*gemfile.
# On CI, we use it for the Appraisal-based builds.
# We do not load the standard Gemfile, as it is tailored for local development.

# NOTE: Due to variations in relative pathing, we can't use the gemfiles/modular gemfiles here,
#       since they would be added to the Appraisals gemfiles with the wrong relative path.
